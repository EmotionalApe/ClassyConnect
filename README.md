# ClassyConnect
ClassyConnect is an innovative software utility designed to effortlessly **discover your next class with a simple click**. By inputting your batch name, this powerful tool eliminates the tedious process of opening PDFs and manually searching for your class's subject and location. 

Behind the scenes, ClassyConnect operates on a robust Python backend, leveraging the efficiency of the **pandas library**. The original timetable data, stored in an **Excel file, is seamlessly transformed into a Pandas DataFrame**. Through **intelligent queries**, the app matches the current time with your class and batch, ensuring accurate information retrieval. 

On the frontend, ClassyConnect utilizes the **Kivy Python library** to provide a sleek and intuitive user interface.
